;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Provide command `opam-switch-set-switch' to change the opam switch
;; of the running Emacs session and minor mode `opam-switch-mode' to
;; select the opam switch via a menu-bar menu.
;;
;; `opam-switch-set-switch' reads the name of the switch in the
;; minibuffer, providing completion with all available switches.  With
;; no input (i.e., leaving the minibuffer empty) the environment is
;; reset to the state before the first call of
;; `opam-switch-set-switch'.
;;
;; The menu is generated each time the minor mode is enabled and
;; contains the switches that are known at that time.  If you create a
;; new switch, re-enable the minor mode to get it added to the menu.
;; The menu contains an additional entry "reset" to reset the
;; environment to the state when Emacs was started.
;;
;; For obvious reasons, `opam-switch-set-switch' does not change the
;; switch of any other shell.
;;
;; See https://opam.ocaml.org for comprehensive documentation on opam.

The switch is set such that all process invocations from
Emacs respect the newly set opam switch.  In addition to setting

also sets variable `exec-path', which controls Emacs'
subprocesses (`call-process', `make-process' and similar
